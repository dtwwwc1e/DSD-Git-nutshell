# DSD-Git-nutshell
UCL DSD In a Nutshell - Git version control

# One-hour session
## format
- 40 minutes: demo*
- 15 minutes: Q&A

### *demo?
- I think we ought to "strongly suggest" that delegates have use of a (linux) environment for command line Git.
- This allows delegates to "hands on" and follow along.
- "how to" set up: as provided in Software Carpentries: see Material

# Purpose
-- what is version control
-- how it might benefit work, research or study

# After the training
-- delegates will have basic knowledge of version control
-- delegates can take further training, e.g. DSD, ARC Software Carpentries etc.

# Material
- Suggest use https://github.com/UCL-ARC/dsh_git
- Adapted from https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/

# Trainers
- joint venture DSD and ARC: David W, Jim T, Tom C, Ed L
- take turn, share etc.
